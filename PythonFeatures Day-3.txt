Python Features
-----------------
1) Easy to Learn and Use
--------------------------
--> Python is easy to learn as compared to other programming languages.
Its syntax is straight forward and much the same as the English language.
There is no use of the semicolon or curly-bracket,
the indentation defines the code block. 
so
It is the recommended programming language for beginners.




2) Expressive Language
----------------------
Python can perform complex tasks using a few lines of code.
A simple example, the hello world program you simply 
type print("Hello World"). 
It will take only one line to execute, while Java or C takes multiple lines.




3) Interpreted Language
-----------------------
Python is an interpreted language; it means the Python program 
is executed one line at a time. The advantage of being interpreted 
language, it makes debugging easy and portable.




4) Free and Open Source
-----------------------
Python is freely available for everyone. 
It is freely available on its official website www.python.org. 
It has a large community across the world that is dedicatedly working 
towards make new python modules and functions. 
Anyone can contribute to the Python community. 
The open-source means, "Anyone can download its source code 
without paying any penny."


5) Object-Oriented Language
----------------------------
Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes
and objects come into existence. 
It supports inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, etc. 
The object-oriented procedure helps to programmer
to write reusable code and develop applications in less code.


6) Extensible
-------------
It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to 
compile the code and thus it can be used further 
in our Python code. It converts the program into byte code,
and any platform can use that byte code.

7) Large Standard Library
-------------------------
It provides a vast range of libraries for the various fields such 
as machine learning, web developer, and also for the scripting. 
There are various machine learning libraries, 
such as Tensor flow, Pandas, Numpy, Keras, and Pytorch, etc. 
Django, flask, pyramids are the popular framework for Python web development.

9) GUI Programming Support
----------------------------
Graphical User Interface is used for the developing 
Desktop application. PyQT5, Tkinter, 
Kivy are the libraries which are used for developing the web application.

10. Embeddable
--------------
The code of the other programming language can use 
in the Python source code. We can use Python 
source code in another programming language as well. 
It can embed other language into our code.

12. Dynamic Memory Allocation
------------------------------
In Python, we don't need to specify the data-type of the variable. 
When we assign some value to the variable, it automatically 
allocates the memory to the variable at run time. 

Suppose we are assigned integer value 15 to x, 
then 
we don't need to write int x = 15. Just write x = 15.
